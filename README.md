## A database of FRBs for koshka :cat:

<div align="justify">

This is a database of all the **F**ast **R**adio **B**ursts (**FRBs**) detected till date. It is a mirror of the excellent database maintained by [*Apostolos Karalis*][0xCoto] as part of the [**FRBSTATS**][FRBSTATS] project. [**FRBSTATS**][FRBSTATS] is an open source project aimed at making a comprehensive and updated database of FRB detections. It provides a web interface to visualise this data, as well as an API which can be used to access the data as CSV or JSON. This repository extracts the database from the FRBSTATS Google Sheet, the link for which can be found at their GitHub repository [here][FRBSTATS-repo].

This database powers the [**koshka :cat: project**][koshka].
